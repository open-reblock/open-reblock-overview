## General Notes and READMEs for the whole Open Reblock project

This project aims to create a web-based service, and public front end, for an open-source code base that develops the least-invasive network of roads or paths to bring infrastructure to informal settlements.

This repository is mainly home to the overall [project wiki](https://github.com/open-reblock/open-reblock-overview/wiki).

At the moment, the project consists of two repositories (in addition to this no-code repo):

1. open-reblock-web, the user interface and visualization code for the Open Reblock project
2. localcode, a fork of another codebase that provides shapefile verification and processing, as well as a basic Django foundation on which to build the openrebolck site.
2. topology, the core system that computes new network diagrams.
