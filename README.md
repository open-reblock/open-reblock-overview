## General Notes and READMEs for the whole Open Reblock project

This project aims to create a web-based service, and public front end, for an open-source code base that develops the least-invasive network of roads or paths to bring infrastructure to informal settlements.

This repository is mainly home to the overall [project wiki](https://github.com/open-reblock/open-reblock-overview/wiki).

At the moment, the project consists of two repositories (in addition to this no-code repo):

1. open-reblock-web, the user interface and visualization code for the Open Reblock project
2. topology, the back end system that will receive and verify input files, compute new network diagrams, and return new vector files to the front end.
